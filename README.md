# psonoclient

A CLI client for the Psono password manager, written in Python, usable for scripting purposes.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install psonoclient
```

## Usage
`psono` has some global mandatory and optional arguments and a few subcommands that come with their own arguments.
You always have to write the global arguments first, then the subcommand and then its arguments.

### General usage
```
usage: psono [-h] [--endpoint <URL>] [--api-key-id <ID>] [--api-key-private-key <Key>] [--api-key-secret-key <Key>] [--format <Format>] [--insecure] [--server-signature <Signature>] [--client-cert-key <Key>]
             [--client-cert-crt <Certificate>] [--verbose]
             {version,info,users,settings,ls,get} ...

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Mandatory arguments:
  Without these arguments a connection to a Psono server is not possible

  --endpoint <URL>, -e <URL>
                        The endpoint of the Psono server including the protocol (e.g. https://psono.example.com/server).
  --api-key-id <ID>     The API Key ID in the form xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.
  --api-key-private-key <Key>

                        The secret API Key in the form of a 64 character long hex number.

Formatting:
  For now there is just that one argument to format the output.

  --format <Format>, -f <Format>
                        The output format (one of: yaml, json, columns, python, plain).

  --server-signature <Signature>
                        The servers signature in form of a 64 character long hex number to check against.

Authentication:
  In case you need additional authentication against the Psono server.

  --client-cert-key <Key>
                        The client certificates key needed to connect to the endpoint.
  --client-cert-crt <Certificate>
